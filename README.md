# LANGUAGE-PROCESSING-LAB
C Programs for problems like DFA, NFA questions. Helpful for starting coding in this field.

Each folder has a .c file and a document with algorithms, diagrams, transition tables and sample output 

# Prerequisite:
Basic C coding knowledge
Basic knowledge in Theory of Computation 

# Programs

1. C program to implement a DFA for the regular expression (a/b)*abb using IF-ELSE.
2. C program to implement a DFA for the regular expression 1*2*3* using transition table.
3. C program to implement a DFA accepting binary strings ending with ‘00’.
4. C program to implement a DFA accepting strings made of {a,b,c} having ‘abc’ as a substring. (USE TRANSITION TABLE INSTEAD OF IF-ELSE)
5. C program to implement a DFA accepting binary strings such that every ‘00’ is immediately followed by 1.(USE TRANSITION TABLE INSTEAD OF IF-ELSE)
